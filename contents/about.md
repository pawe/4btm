Hi! I'm Paul. <br>I like to think about time machines and the future in general, more so than is possible good for me or anyone.

I also can't write and this is my way to progress from a bad writer to a 'slightly less bad' writer. If you find mistakes or can suggest a better way for me to clarify what I'm trying to say, drop me an email or create an issue [here][1].
