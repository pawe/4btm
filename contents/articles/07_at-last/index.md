If the physical phenomenon would be known to you, I'm sure you would be able to build a 4bTM yourself, quite likely even a better one. Anyway, thank you for your interest and one last question: How would you use a 4bTM?

## That's it

Being able to send long texts, pictures, videos etc. a proper amount of time back to the past is apparently very nice. If it wouldn't also make it very easy to do malicious things. A person with early unrestricted access to such a 4 bit time machine must be incredibly stupid not to achieve world domination within very few time lines. A true enabling technology that's introduction probably should be handled with care.

Assume I have hooked up a 4bTM like described on this site to an email server when registering this domain (mid 2015). What would you send to yourself or someone else? Please tell me via __messagetothepast (at) 4btm.com__. Assume that your and other peoples messages are batched together. Sorry, you won't get your own (outer) time line. As explained in detail the message will not affect your current self. Again sorry, it's not a very powerful time machine. One last sorry, the messages will be analyzed by scientists.

Other feedback is also very much appreciated (obviously, there is room for improvement). My plan is to write down the "history of a time machine" when I retire. What you see here are some of my notes. The story might cover something about the people actually building the time machinery (not just the engineers, there are a lot of people necessary to create a time machine), the TM itself in more details (_T_-particle stabilizers, _p_-particle generators/synchronizers, sensors, field generators, fast enough computing, etc.) and a bit about the political impact its introduction had. Probably causing a war.

I hope you liked this intro into time technology engineering. That it wasn’t too confusing and included some novel thoughts. Maybe you even got a little bit inspired to think about time technology a bit differently. After all…

> Time was invented by humans to describe motion when the motion we knew was only continuous.
